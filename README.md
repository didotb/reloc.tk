# Reloc.tk Private URL Shortener
This [URL Shortener](https://reloc.tk) was made in order to make my life easier transfering links from one device to another.

~~Database resets randomly multiple times a week.~~ Things have changed. Read further below for more details.

### Ran using Python 3.x with:
+ PyMongo
+ Flask
  + SimpleLogin
  + Templates
  + Bootstrap
  + Compress
  + QRcode
+ GnuPG
+ WTForms
+ PyCryptodome

## Hosting status
~~I might consider opening this up in public with signups if I get the resources. But for now, since this is being hosted in [Replit](https://replit.com/@ddotb/reloctk) for free, resource is limited.~~

**Thank you to [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/ "Clever Cloud website") for the Mongo DB hosting.**

Since I have found a tiny free MongoDB hosting service,
shortener is now available for everyone to use.
**PLEASE NOTE** however that the registration and the login pages
are currently being monitored since both pages were built
from scratch with WTForms. **Bugs and broken stuff may surface as you use the site.
Please report anything that could break the entire site or your experience
using the site**. Thank you for using this mini service.
