# Reloc.tk Private URL Shortener
This [URL Shortener](https://reloc.tk) was made in order to make my life easier transfering links from one device to another.

Database resets randomly multiple times a week.

### Ran using Python 3.x with:
+ PyMongo
+ Flask
  + SimpleLogin
  + Templates
  + Bootstrap
  + Compress
+ GnuPG
+ WTForms
+ PyCryptodome

## Future plans:
I might consider opening this up in public with signups if I get the resources. But for now, since this is being hosted in [Replit](https://replit.com/@ddotb/reloctk) for free, resource is limited.
